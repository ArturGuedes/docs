The **ON/OFF Ramp Module** in the Lumx API provides a seamless interface for converting between fiat and cryptocurrency, enabling businesses to integrate these transitions effortlessly into their platforms. This module supports flexible flows that abstract the complexities of provider-specific implementations.

#### **On-Ramp Process**

The **On-Ramp** process enables customers to convert fiat currency into cryptocurrency, which is then deposited into their designated wallets.

##### **Overview:**

1. **Customer Request:**

   * The client initiates an on-ramp request by specifying:

     * Customer details.

     * Exchange rate.

     * Desired cryptocurrency.

     * Fiat amount to be converted.

   * Lumx validates the request and prepares the necessary transaction details.

2. **Payment Generation:**

   * Lumx generates a payment instruction (e.g., Pix code or similar) and provides it to the customer for fiat payment.

   * A transaction is created with the status `awaiting_payment`.

3. **Payment Confirmation:**

   * Once the customer completes the payment, Lumx receives a confirmation (via webhook or provider notification).

   * The transaction status is updated to `funds_received`.

4. **Cryptocurrency Delivery:**

   * Lumx facilitates the purchase of the specified cryptocurrency and transfers it to the customer’s designated wallet.

   * The transaction is finalized with the status `success` upon confirmation of the crypto transfer.

#### **Off-Ramp Process**

The **Off-Ramp** process allows customers to convert cryptocurrency into fiat currency, which is then transferred to their bank accounts.

##### **Overview:**

1. **Customer Request:**

   * The client initiates an off-ramp request by providing:

     * Customer details.

     * Exchange rate.

     * Cryptocurrency to be sold and its amount.

     * Bank account or payment details for fiat transfer.

   * Lumx validates the ownership of the destination account to ensure compliance.

2. **Transaction Setup:**

   * Lumx prepares a transaction for the crypto-to-fiat conversion, requiring customer authorization.

   * The transaction starts with the status `awaiting_signature`.

3. **Cryptocurrency Transfer:**

   * The customer authorizes and executes the transfer of the specified cryptocurrency to the Lumx or provider-designated wallet.

   * The transaction status is updated to `pending` or `processing`.

4. **Fiat Transfer:**

   * Lumx facilitates the sale of the cryptocurrency and initiates a fiat transfer to the customer’s specified account.

   * Upon confirmation of the fiat transfer, the transaction status is updated to `success`.

### **Transaction Lifecycle for ON/OFF Ramp**

Both on-ramp and off-ramp processes share a common lifecycle to ensure transparency and traceability:

* **Statuses:**

  * `awaiting_payment`: Awaiting customer action to complete fiat payment.

  * `awaiting_signature`: Waiting for customer authorization for a crypto transfer.

  * `funds_received`: Fiat payment or crypto transfer has been confirmed.

  * `pending` or `processing`: In-progress actions such as crypto purchase, transfer, or fiat payout.

  * `success`: Transaction completed successfully.

* **Webhooks:**
  Lumx integrates provider notifications via webhooks to confirm critical actions, such as payment receipt, crypto purchase, and fiat transfer.
