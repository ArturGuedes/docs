At the accounts level we have the following terms to disclose:

* Client: you, our Lumx client, that has accepted to use our APIs

* Customer: Users of your business&#x20;

* Wallet: Leveraging Account Abstraction, our wallets provide flexible and powerful control over blockchain transactions and wallet logic.

### Customers

Customers represent users of your business. By creating or updating your customers with LUMX through our API you can enable seamless transfers of stablecoins or fiat currencies from or to your customer's wallets or bank accounts.&#x20;

We currently handle a soft KYC (Name, Tax ID and Birth Date) for your users in compliance with legal requirements when using our on/off ramp processes.&#x20;

Deeper KYC/KYB options will be provided soon.&#x20;

### Wallets

Programmable wallets are ideal for applications requiring conditional transfers, complex multi-step blockchain interactions, special filters, or account recovery mechanisms, turning them into a key component that helps make blockchain accessible to regular “non-crypto-native” users.

* Multi Key Management Providers

Security and accessibility are paramount in blockchain operations. We supports multiple key management providers such as Fireblocks for MPC (multi-party computation) or Google for HSM (hardware security modules), ensuring enterprise-grade security and compliance while giving flexibility to developers to choose a preferred key management system. You can also bring your own key management provider.

* Gas Management

To address the UX challenges of users needing to possess cryptocurrencies to cover transaction fees on blockchain networks, our Wallet module includes an innovative gas management feature utilizing a “gas sponsorship” system. This approach enables more predictable cost management and can be especially beneficial during periods of network congestion. You can choose to sponsor gas fees to your users (or let them pay) with fiat or tokens in a given blockchain.

### Passkey Protection

Enhancing security further, our Wallet module incorporates passkey protection, leveraging the latest innovations in authentication technology to secure access to wallets. This feature offers an option to traditional password systems with a more robust authentication mechanism, giving users the ability to use Face ID and fingerprints to access their wallets and make transactions.
