Our Webhook system provides updates on the status of transactions, ensuring seamless integration with your application. This system sends `HTTPS` POST requests to a specified `URL`.

## Creating webhooks

To create a webhook, head to the [dashboard](https://dashboard.lumx.io/) and go to the Settings page, then click on the Webhooks tab. There you can register your webhook and set the events you want to receive.

<Note>You need to be an project admin or owner to create a webhook.</Note>

## Events

The webhook will be triggered for every asynchronous status change.

<Tabs>
	<Tab title='On-ramp'>
		Called when the transaction first enters the `awaiting_funds` status from
		`processing`. The second call will be triggered when the transaction moves
		from `awaiting_funds` to `success` or `failed`.
	</Tab>
	<Tab title='Off-ramp'>
		Called when the transaction changes from `processing` to `success` or
		`failed`.
	</Tab>
	<Tab title='Transfer'>
		Called when the transaction changes from `processing` to `success` or
		`failed`.
	</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Webhook payload

Here is an example of the payload delivered to your webhook URL:

```json
{
	"id": "86030912-a5fc-4351-b596-0cfaf766b638",
	"customerId": "77e04882-c54e-4203-afd9-d0d963598dc5",
	"type": "on_ramp",
	"request": {
		"amount": "15",
		"payment": {
			"rail": "pix"
		},
		"sourceCurrency": "BRL",
		"targetCurrency": "USDC"
	},
	"state": {
		"status": "success",
		"payment": {
			"rail": "pix"
		},
		"receipt": {
			"fees": {
				"lumx": {
					"flat": "1.500000",
					"percentage": "0.000752"
				},
				"total": "1.530902",

				"blockExplorerUrl": "https://amoy.polygonscan.com/tx/0xc30abe7bc2c90c90a5ab0cb5666a752a1d87c811ac8e24aa031037bb9df23b68"
			},
			"sourceAmount": "15",
			"targetAmount": "0.984648",

		}
	},
	"createdAt": "2025-03-20T13:49:44.209Z",
	"updatedAt": "2025-03-20T13:55:52.610Z"
}
```

## Security

The API signs the event by adding a `X-Hub-Signature` header to the request. This signature can be used to verify the authenticity of the request by following the steps below:

<Steps>
	<Step title='First Step'>
		Go to the webhook settings page and copy the secret.
	</Step>
	<Step title='Second Step'>
		Compute an `HMAC-SHA256` hash of the payload using the secret as the **key**
		and the stringified payload as the **message**. The decoding algorithm is
		`hex`.
	</Step>
	<Step title='Third Step'>
		Compare the generated signature with the one received in the
		`X-Hub-Signature` header.
	</Step>
</Steps>
