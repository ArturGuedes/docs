By creating a developer fee, you can collect customized fees as funds are transferred using our platform. The fees are split at the moment of the transaction, taken out of the customer's transaction amount, and deposited in a wallet designated for you.

## How to create a developer fee

To create a developer fee, you need to go to the [dashboard](https://dashboard.lumx.io/?to=%2Fsettings%2Fdeveloper-fees), select the project, go to the Settings page, and create your fee.

<Note>
  You need to be a project admin or owner to create a developer fee.

### EVM wallet

In order for us to send the fees to you, you need to register a valid EVM wallet address. You can either use a wallet generated by us or add your proprietary treasury wallet. You can use our sandbox mode to verify that the address is correctly receiving funds.

### Fee configuration

The API supports both flat and percentage fees for on/off-ramp transactions.

### Revenue

Currently, the revenue is shown on the developer fees page.
