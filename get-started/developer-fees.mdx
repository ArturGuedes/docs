By creating a developer fee, you can earn revenue based off on the values of the transactions created on your project by adding a spread on top of the Lumx's fees. The amount is split on the moment of the transaction.

## How to create a developer fee

To create a developer fee, you need to go to the [dashboard](https://dashboard.lumx.io/), click on the **Settings** tab, and then head to the **Developer Fees** tab.

<Note>You need to be an project admin or owner to create a developer fee.</Note>

### EVM wallet

In order for us to send the revenue to you, you need to register a valid EVM wallet address. You can use our sandbox mode to verify that the address is correctly receiving funds.

### Fees

The API supports both flat and percentage fees for on/off-ramp transactions.

### Revenue

Currently, the revenue is shown on the developer fees page.
