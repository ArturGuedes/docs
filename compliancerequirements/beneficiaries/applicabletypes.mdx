⚠️ **Important:** The values indicated below **do not represent the transaction limits permitted on the Lumx platform**. They are exclusively used to determine which levels of KYC (Know Your Customer) or KYB (Know Your Business) will be applied according to the intended transaction amounts.

In other words, as transaction amounts increase, more stringent verification and compliance levels are required to ensure security and regulatory compliance.
