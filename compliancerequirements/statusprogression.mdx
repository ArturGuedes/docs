KYC/KYB status can progress according to the following flow:

* PENDING → UNDER REVIEW → APPROVED

For low-risk regions, the review process can be completed within seconds. However, in high-risk locations or cases requiring manual review, verification may take 1 to 2 business days.

* PENDING → UNDER REVIEW → CHANGES REQUESTED → APPROVED / REJECTED

If the entity's provided information is incomplete or inconsistent, Lumx may request corrections or additional documents before concluding the review.

* PENDING → UNDER REVIEW → REJECTED

In some cases, an entity may be rejected if the submitted information is invalid or inconsistent, such as an incorrect tax identification number or unrecognized documents.
