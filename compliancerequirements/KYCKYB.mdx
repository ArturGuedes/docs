Any entity registered with Lumx must undergo a Know-Your-Customer (“KYC”) or Know-Your-Business (“KYB”) process, depending on its type (individual or corporate).

 The KYC/KYB verification process includes the collection of essential information, including:

 ·        Full name, address, and identification details for individuals involved;

·         Corporate structure, tax ID, and registration documents for companies;

·         Proof of identity, address, and relevant financial information.

These data points allow Lumx to validate the entity’s identity and ensure that developers and partners comply with local Anti-Money Laundering (“AML”) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (“CFT”) regulations.

Lumx's client API allows this information to be sent directly to our platform, providing developers with full flexibility to manage how they collect customer data.
