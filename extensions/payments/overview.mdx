The Payments Module provides a unified API for integrating cryptocurrency payment services into your application. By abstracting multiple industry-leading payment providers behind a single interface, developers can easily implement fiat-to-crypto (on-ramp) and crypto-to-fiat (off-ramp) functionality while maintaining full control over their provider selection.

With Payins, individuals and businesses can top up their balances using selected stablecoins such as USDC and USDT, providing a straightforward path to enter the crypto ecosystem.
