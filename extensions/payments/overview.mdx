The Payments Module provides a unified API for integrating stablecoin orchestration services into your application. By abstracting the complexity of payment flows behind a single interface, developers can easily implement fiat-to-crypto (pay-ins) and crypto-to-fiat (payouts) functionalities while maintaining full control over their flow of funds.

With Pay-ins, we make it simple for individuals and businesses to on-ramp into stablecoins using a wide range of payment methods.

With Payouts, we enable seamless off-ramps to convert stablecoins into fiat currency. Simply programmatically transfer stablecoins to Lumx and specify where and through which payment method you want to receive fiat. We handle all the underlying conversions and fund orchestration required to deposit fiat into the designated bank account.
