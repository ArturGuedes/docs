Individuals or companies that will receive payments or stablecoins.

For compliance purposes, every beneficiary is also considered the originator of the stablecoins. This means that when creating a beneficiary and initiating a payment from a blockchain wallet, the beneficiary will be regarded as the source of the stablecoins.

It is possible to link multiple bank accounts and blockchain wallets to the same beneficiary.
