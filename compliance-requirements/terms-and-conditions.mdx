All customers using Lumx services must agree to our [Terms and Conditions (“TC”)](https://lumx.io/terms-of-use) and our [Privacy Policy](https://lumx.io/privacy-policy). The preferred approach is to integrate these documents within the entity’s documentation, ensuring end users review and accept the terms before using Lumx services.

If incorporating the TS directly is not feasible, we provide a dedicated [Terms and Conditions](https://lumx.io/terms-of-use)[ link](https://lumx.io/terms-of-use). Entities can share this link with their end users to ensure they agree to the terms before proceeding with Lumx services.
