All customers using Lumx services must agree to our [Terms of Service (“TS”)](https://lumx.io/terms-of-use) and our [Privacy Policy](https://lumx.io/privacy-policy). The preferred approach is to integrate these documents within the entity’s documentation, ensuring end users review and accept the terms before using Lumx services.

If incorporating the TS directly is not feasible, we provide a dedicated Terms of Service link. Entities can share this link with their end users to ensure they agree to the terms before proceeding with Lumx services.

All customers using Lumx services must agree to our Terms of Service ("TU"). The preferred approach is to incorporate our TU into the entity's documentation, ensuring its end users accept these terms before accessing the services.

Alternatively, we provide a dedicated [Terms of Use link](https://lumx.io/terms-of-use), which can be shared with entities so that their end users accept the terms before proceeding.
