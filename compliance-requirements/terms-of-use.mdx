All customers using Lumx services must agree to our Terms of Use ("TU"). The preferred approach is to incorporate our TU into the entity's documentation, ensuring that its end users accept these terms before accessing the services.

Â Alternatively, we provide a dedicated Terms of Use link, which can be shared with entities so that their end users accept the terms before proceeding.
